The first expansion sequel, \"\", takes place immediately after the events of \"Half-Life 2\", with the player taking on the role of Gordon Freeman once again and with Alyx Vance playing a more prominent role. \"\" continues directly from the ending of \"Episode One\", with Alyx and Gordon making their way to White Forest Missile base, a hideout of the resistance. A third episode is set to be released in the future, completing an intended trilogy. In a June 2006 interview with Eurogamer, Gabe Newell revealed that the \"Half-Life 2\" \"episodes\" are essentially \"Half-Life 3\". He reasons that rather than force fans to wait another six years for a full sequel, Valve Corporation would release the game in episodic installments. Newell stated that a more accurate title for these episodes would have been \"\"Half-Life 3: Episode One\"\" and so forth, having referred to the episodes as \"Half-Life 3\" repeatedly throughout the interview. In a May 2011 interview with Develop, Newell stated that the episodic model had been replaced by even shorter development cycles and continuous updates via Steam.",

It provides the information stored in it to the user and the DBA, but it is mainly accessed by the various software modules of the DBMS itself, such as DDL and DML compilers, the query optimiser, the transaction processor, report generators, and the constraint enforcer. On the other hand, a \"data dictionary\" is a data structure that stores metadata, i.e., (structured) data about information. The software package for a stand-alone data dictionary or data repository may interact with the software modules of the DBMS, but it is mainly used by the designers, users and administrators of a computer system for information resource management. These systems maintain information on system hardware and software configuration, documentation, application and users as well as other information relevant to system administration.",

For comparison, a typical drug is made to bind to the active site of an enzyme which thus prohibits binding of a substrate to that enzyme causing a decrease in enzyme activity. Allosteric modulation occurs when an effector binds to an allosteric site (also known as a regulatory site) of an enzyme and alters the enzyme activity. Allosteric modulators are designed to fit the allosteric site to cause a conformational change of the enzyme, in particular a change in the shape of the active site, which then causes a change in its activity. In contrast to typical drugs, modulators are not competitive inhibitors. They can be positive (activating) causing an increase of the enzyme activity or negative (inhibiting) causing a decrease of the enzyme activity. The use of allosteric modulation allows the control of the effects of specific enzyme activities; as a result, allosteric modulators are very effective in pharmacology.",

Panama sold the Canal Zone (consisting of the Panama Canal and an area generally extending on each side of the centerline) to the United States for $10 million and a steadily increasing yearly sum. In February 1904, Roosevelt won Senate ratification of the treaty in a 66-to-14 vote. The Isthmian Canal Commission, supervised by Secretary of War Taft, was established to govern the zone and oversee the construction of the canal. Roosevelt appointed George Whitefield Davis as the first governor of the Panama Canal Zone and John Findley Wallace as the Chief Engineer of the canal project. When Wallace resigned in 1905, Roosevelt appointed John Frank Stevens, who built a railroad in the canal zone and initiated the construction of a lock canal. Stevens was replaced in 1907 by George Washington Goethals, who saw construction through to its completion. Roosevelt traveled to Panama in November 1906 to inspect progress on the canal, becoming the first sitting president to travel outside of the United States.",

She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, \"The words don\u2019t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean [th]em\", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, \"It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel, but I still need to\" before asking again, \"Why is that?\".

This benefit in particular is thought to be an important driving force in the evolution of peritrophic matrices, as many insects feeding on foods with low pathogen levels lack the ability to produce a peritrophic matrix. This trend is highlighted by mosquitoes, as blood-feeding female mosquitoes produce a peritrophic matrix while nectar-feeding males do not. A significant trend can also be observed in the type of peritrophic matrix produced by blood-feeding insects that are capable of transmitting disease. The majority of blood-feeding insects that are good disease vectors produce a type I matrix. In comparison, blood-feeding insects that produce a type II matrix, which provides a more impenetrable barrier to pathogens, are rarely disease vectors.",

The breakdown of glycogen, a process known as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P). The G-1-P is converted to G-6-P by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. G-6-P is readily fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G-6-P concentration is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. During muscular activity, the store of ATP needs to be constantly replenished. When the supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product of glycolysis, into the Krebs cycle.",

For example, some brown alga (\"Phaeophyceae\") reproduce by producing multi-flagellated male and female gametes that recombine to form the diploid sporangia. Zoids are primarily found in some protists, diatoms, green alga, brown alga, non-vascular plants, and a few vascular plants (ferns, cycads, and \"Ginkgo biloba\"). The most common classification group that produces zoids is the heterokonts or stramenopiles. These include green alga, brown alga, oomycetes, and some protists. The term is generally not used to describe motile, flagellated sperm found in animals. Zoid is also commonly confused for zooid which is a single organism that is part of a colonial animal.",

Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue. The deepest layer, the hypodermis, is primarily made up of adipose tissue.

However, the stone is actually a dragon egg. Eragon names the dragon Saphira from the list of dragon's names he heard from the story teller Brom. Saphira's hatching attracts the attention of the cruel king Galbatorix. The king dispatches servants to Eragon's village to find the dragon. They are unsuccessful and Eragon's uncle is killed and his home burned down. Brom, whom Eragon considers as nothing more than an old storyteller, helps him fight his way out of the village. He then gives Eragon an old sword, known as Zar'roc in the book series .",

The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. The error signal is the departure of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.",

Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition. The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches, and in the first half of the 20th century, kudzu was distributed as a high-protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion. It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl. The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government-aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government-funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare. By 1946, it was estimated that of kudzu had been planted. When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms, kudzu plantings were left unattended. The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked. In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970. By 1997, the vine was placed on the \"Federal Noxious Weed List\". Today, kudzu is estimated to cover of land in the southeastern United States, mostly in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Mississippi. It has been recorded in Nova Scotia, Canada, in Columbus, Ohio, and in all five boroughs of New York City.",

Earthquakes of this type account for more than 90 percent of the total seismic energy released around the world. If one plate is trying to move past the other, they will be locked until sufficient stress builds up to cause the plates to slip relative to each other. The slipping process creates an earthquake with relative displacement on either side of the fault, resulting in seismic waves which travel through the Earth and along the Earth's surface. Relative plate motion can be lateral as along a transform fault boundary, vertical if along a convergent boundary (i.e. subduction or thrust/reverse faulting) or a divergent boundary (i.e. rift zone or normal faulting), and oblique, with horizontal and lateral components at the boundary. Interplate earthquakes associated at a subduction boundary are called megathrust earthquakes, which are the most powerful earthquakes.",

While some people think of these averages as representing normal or ideal measurements, a wide range of temperatures has been found in healthy people. The body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities change. Other circumstances also affect the body's temperature. The core body temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the second half of the sleep cycle; the lowest point, called the nadir, is one of the primary markers for circadian rhythms.

This is true of the systemic circulation, by far the larger of the two circuits of blood in the body, which transports oxygen from the heart to the tissues of the body. However, in pulmonary circulation, the arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, and veins return blood from the lungs to the heart. The difference between veins and arteries is their direction of flow (out of the heart by arteries, returning to the heart for veins), not their oxygen content. In addition, deoxygenated blood that is carried from the tissues back to the heart for reoxygenation in the systemic circulation still carries some oxygen, though it is considerably less than that carried by the systemic arteries or pulmonary veins.",

The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that \"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.

In season three, Jonathan was absent for a few episodes - he was with his grandparents - when he returned, he and Eric challenged Jenny's authority over the school by sitting higher on \"the steps\" than her and her cronies, this resulted in Eric being splattered with yogurt.

After a period of no improvement of intestinal function or motility the decision to start TPN will be made, and the surgical procedure to add a long-term, more permanent IV to administer TPN will occur. Types of IV catheters to be placed will be a PICC line or central line which include mediports, Broviac, or Hickman lines depending on how long the physicians believe the patient will require TPN. Patients that are deemed TPN dependent will require constant checkups to monitor the catheter is working properly, check liver enzyme levels and look for signs of blood infections, as catheter blockage, liver damage, and infections of catheters are the main complications associated with long term TPN use and can result in sepsis and/or additional surgeries if not properly monitored. TPN nutritional feeds are given over a period of several hours to all day infusions, and are a mixture of all the vitamins, minerals, and calories similar to what one would get eating orally daily as well as any other specific nutritional needs the patient has at the moment. TPN format is typically changed depending on loss/gain of weight and bloodwork results, and is specially formulated to meet each individual patient's needs.",

The Doctor examines a toy and remarks, \"Robot dog; not as much fun as I remember,\" alluding to K-9, a robot dog who accompanied the Fourth Doctor. The Doctor claims to be able to \"speak 'baby'\", as he did in \"A Good Man Goes to War\". The Doctor expresses his dislike for Craig's \"redecorated\" house by using a line from the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in \"The Three Doctors\" (1973) and \"The Five Doctors\" (1983). The Doctor recites the mini-poem \"Not a rat, a cybermat\" from the novelisation of \"Revenge of the Cybermen\".",

In the midst of the ensuing battle between the Avengers and the Hulk and Namor, Odin grants Thor's request to be able to retain his powers without his hammer for five minutes so that he might test his strength against the Hulk. The two fight to a stalemate before the tunnel they are fighting in collapses and are forced to separate. The two battle again in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #255 (1968), \"The Defenders\" #10 (1973), \"The Mighty Thor\" #385 (1987), \"Heroes Reborn\" #2 (1996), \"The Avengers\" #5 (1997), \"The Incredible Hulk Annual 2001\" and \"Onslaught Reborn\" #2 (2006). Despite this Thor respects the Hulk and they eventually become friends after Thor aids Hulk in defeating the Red Hulk. The rivalry comes to a head during the events of \"Fear Itself\", in which Thor fights Hulk, who has been turned into Nul: Breaker of Worlds. During their battle Thor states that he has always thought of Hulk as \"a pain in the ass.\" Once the battle nears a conclusion Thor says to Hulk \"I cannot beat you, you know. And I never could,\" to bait the Hulk into moving in for the takedown. Thor then uses Mjolnir to knock Hulk into outerspace.",

She says, \"The first image of the film starts with a very surreal image, but as you go into the film, you can feel the reality of being a fugitive. And I love this image very much and I think it can carry different meanings. It can express social, philosophic, and poetical meaning -- so many metaphors, and yet also, you can go into their reality. The idea for the film came out of my father's mind when I was looking for a subject to do for my next film. He gave me three or four pages and then it was time for me to imagine it. But I couldn't simply imagine it. How can I sit here in Cannes and think of people living in Kurdistan? So I had to go in it and be involved in it. So I cast the actors and found my locations, and at the same time, I let the reality of the situation come in. I don't want to kill the subject and put it in front of the camera and just shoot it as a dead subject. I let the reality come into imagination. I believe that metaphors are born from the imagination of the artist and the reality of life making love to each other. An example: Imagine more than a hundred old men want to go back to their country. This is imagination and reality. It's reality because there are some older generations that want to go back to their country to die. This is real. But just being old men is imagination. Or just being one woman is imagination. Or carrying these white boards is a combination of reality and imagination. Because maybe it's possible, if you're a refugee, if you're a teacher, what can you do except carry your blackboard and look for students? They are like street vendors, shouting, \"Come, try to learn something!\" In such a dire situation, everyone is poor, so nobody can learn anything. It is imagination, but it could exist.\"",

A methyl group is added to GAA from the amino acid methionine by the enzyme GAMT, forming non-phosphorylated creatine. This is then released into the blood by the liver where it travels mainly to the muscle cells (95% of the body's creatine is in muscles), and to a lesser extent the brain, heart, and pancreas. Once inside the cells it is transformed into phosphocreatine by the enzyme complex creatine kinase, which makes it able to donate its phosphate group to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process is an important component of all vertebrates' bioenergetic systems. For instance, while the human body only produces 250g of ATP daily, it recycles its entire body weight in ATP each day through creatine phosphate.",

Flair, who had gained control of WCW for 90 days on a December 1998 edition of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", ordered referee Charles Robinson to use discretion in stopping the match; as a result, Robinson did not stop the match when Flair bled first, nor would he count for Hogans own pin falls.

Intending for the song to be \"the height of simplicity\", the songwriters drew much of its influence from Broadway music. Due to Ashman's failing health, some of \"Beauty and the Beast\"'s pre-production was relocated to a hotel in Fishkill, New York near Ashman's residence to accommodate the ailing lyricist. Out of all the songs he has written for \"Beauty and the Beast\", Menken devoted the most time to the title song. The track was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury, who voices the character Mrs. Potts, an enchanted teapot. The songwriters first introduced \"Beauty and the Beast\" to Lansbury as a demo recording, which was accompanied by a note asking her if she might possibly be interested in singing it. Although a seasoned film and stage performer who had previously done her own singing for Disney in the musical film \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" (1971), Lansbury, who was more accustomed to performing uptempo songs, was hesitant to record the ballad because of its unfamiliar rock style. Although she liked the song, Lansbury also worried that her aging singing voice was no longer strong enough to record \"Beauty and the Beast\", and was especially concerned about having to sustain its longer notes. Lansbury suggested that the songwriters ask someone else to sing \"Beauty and the Beast\", but they insisted that she simply \"sing the song the way [she] envisioned it\".",

According to British musicologist Simon Frith, pop music is produced \"as a matter of enterprise not art\", and is \"designed to appeal to everyone\" but \"doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste\". Frith adds that it is \"not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward [...] and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative\". It is, \"provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers, and concert promoters) rather than being made from below\u00a0...

It was founded in 744 by Saint Sturm, a disciple of Saint Boniface. Through the 8th and 9th centuries, Fulda Abbey became a prominent center of learning and culture in Germany, and a site of religious significance and pilgrimage following the burial of Boniface. The growth in population around Fulda would result in its elevation to a prince-bishopric in the second half of the 18th century.",

During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin\u00a0II. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\". The Chalukya dynasty ruled parts of southern and central India from Badami in Karnataka between 550 and 750, and then again from Kalyani between 970 and 1190.",

Tex-Mex is very different from the Southwest cuisine found in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. In these areas, the preferred southwest cuisine is New Mexican cuisine, also heavily influenced by authentic Mexican cuisine. The southwestern state of Nevada and West Coast state of California (which is home to Cal-Mex cuisine) tend to lie in the middle as far the preferred style of Mexican-American food. In some places, particularly outside of Texas, \"Tex-Mex\" is used to describe a localized version of Mexican cuisine. It is common for all of these foods to be referred to as \"Mexican food\" in Texas, other parts of the United States, and some other countries. In other ways, it is Southern cooking using the commodities from Mexican culture. In many parts of the U.S. outside of Texas the term is synonymous with Southwestern cuisine.",

Young is considered to be one of the active organizers of the Boston Tea Party although he himself did not actually participate in the destruction of the tea chests. At the time he was addressing a crowd at the Old South Meeting House on the negative health effects of tea drinking.

Powered by a 240\u00a0hp version of the 5.8L V8, the Lightning used a heavy-duty 4-speed automatic transmission from the F-350 (normally paired with the 7.5L V8 or 7.3L diesel V8). While slower in acceleration than the GMC Syclone, the Lightning retained nearly all of the towing and payload capacity of a standard Ford F-150. Produced from 1993 to 1995, the first-generation SVT Lightning was withdrawn as Ford readied the 1997 Ford F-150 for sale.",

The provisional government votes out Sam Houston as commander of the Texas army.

He states that \u201ccontext does not determine (in the sense of constitute), but merely enables the hearer to determine (in the sense of ascertain) what the speaker means.\u201d Context provides constraints on what a speaker can reasonably mean and on what a hearer can reasonably interpret a speaker to mean. \u201ccontextualist platitude\u201d does not preclude the \u201colder picture of language and communication\u201d and \u201ca fairly standard semantic-pragmatic distinction.\u201d Pragmatic considerations and context do not contribute to the content of what is said. Bach admits that there is meaning in utterances beyond the semantic content of a sentence, but he maintains that context does not determine speaker meaning but rather constrains how a speaker can expect to be understood and helps the hearer understand what is said. \u201cWe need the level of locutionary act and, correlatively, a strict, semantic notion of what is said in order to account for (the content of) what a speaker does in uttering a sentence independently of whatever communicative intention (if any) he has in uttering it and regardless of how the content of that intention may depart from the semantic content of the sentence.\u201d",

In 1999, Capcom announced the development of yet another sequel, called \"Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes\". \"Marvel vs. Capcom 2\" heavily re-used assets from previous Capcom-developed games, including \"Street Fighter Alpha\", \"Darkstalkers\", and the earlier \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" titles, resulting in a large roster of 56 playable characters. Shortly after the release of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox ports for \"Marvel vs. Capcom 2\", Capcom lost the use of the Marvel license, putting the series on an indefinite hiatus. However, with the resurgence of the fighting game genre in 2008, owing to the success of \"Street Fighter IV\", Marvel requested Capcom to collaborate with them once again. Capcom would announce the development of the next installment in the \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" series, \"Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds\", in 2010. The game was eventually released in 2011.

However, by mid-2013, with many premium Ultrabooks having high resolution screens (1080p or greater) as standard or upgrades, the MacBook Air was increasingly criticized for sticking with a low-resolution screen. Many in the tech community had expected Apple to release a MacBook Air with Retina Display by mid-2013, similar to the MacBook Pro Retina which came out in 2012. The October 2013 refresh of the 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina, with a slimmer chassis and a lower price point, was mentioned as a potential MacBook Air alternative as the battery life is not much shorter while not being considerably bulkier. Apple released an entry-level version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016, which was specifically targeted towards MacBook Air users. A Retina MacBook Air was released in late 2018.",

Pinkerton's agents performed services which ranged from undercover investigations and detection of crimes, to plant protection and armed security. It is sometimes claimed, probably with exaggeration, that at the height of its existence, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency employed more agents than the United States Army.

A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes\u2019 brush border, duodenal cytochrome B (Dcytb), reduces ferric Fe to Fe. A protein called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which can transport several divalent metals across the plasma membrane, then transports iron across the enterocyte\u2019s cell membrane into the cell.

While working on immunotherapy for cancer, Fakhri found that neither lymphocytes nor antibodies were effective against cancer cells. Inspired by what he had observed in his work with coagulation factors, Dr. Fakhri decided to investigate the cooperation between antibodies and lymphocytes to see if there might be parallels with the way different coagulation factors operated. He found that when lymphocytes were mixed with cancerous cells in the presence of antibodies the lymphocytes encircled the cancer cells and destroyed them. He called these lymphocytes \u201cco-optable lymphocytes.\u201d As other scientists began to explore this phenomenon these lymphocytes came to be called \u201cK cells\u201d or \u201cKiller cells\u201d and were found to play a major role in immune response. Dr. Fakhri's discovery was featured in the scientific journal \"Nature New Biology\".",

New oceanic crust moves away from the spreading center. Over a period of years, the sea floor under Hawaii moved from the East Pacific Rise to its present location west, carrying ancient seamounts with it. When scientists investigated a series of earthquakes off Hawaii in 1970, they discovered that L\u014dihi was an active member of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain.",

In November 2013 the action group won the 2014 Keep Australia Beautiful Award for 'Environmental Innovation and Protection'. As of July 2014, the action group has captured and humanely disposed an estimated 49,000 Indian mynas. The prevalence of the Indian myna in Canberra has been reduced to the sixteenth most prevalent species, with anecdotal evidence of increased observations and nesting by native bird species.

All three branches of the US government have certain powers and those powers relate to the other branches of government. One of these powers is called the express powers. These powers are expressly given, in the Constitution, to each branch of government. Another power is the implied powers. These powers are those that are necessary to perform expressed powers. There are also inherent and concurrent powers. Inherent powers are those that are not found in the Constitution yet the different branches of government can still exercise them. Concurrent powers are those that are given to both state and federal governments. There are also powers that are not lined out in the Constitution that are given to the federal government. These powers are then given to the states in a system called federalism.",

In his time, the wave and particle interpretations of light and matter were seen as being at odds with one another, but de Broglie suggested that these seemingly different characteristics were instead the same behavior observed from different perspectives \u2014 that particles can behave like waves, and waves (radiation) can behave like particles. Broglie's proposal offered an explanation of the restricted motion of electrons within the atom. The first publications of Broglie's idea of \"matter waves\" had drawn little attention from other physicists, but a copy of his doctoral thesis chanced to reach Einstein, whose response was enthusiastic. Einstein stressed the importance of Broglie's work both explicitly and by building further on it.",

Fredro Starr explains what happened to hip-hop over the past 10 years:\"...When Nas said, 'Hip Hop is Dead', it wasn't dead. I just think the sound has changed over the last 10 years, so it's hard for any New York rapper with a New York sound to be progressive, do what they want to do successfully and make money. That's why you had every New York rapper trying to rhyme on Down South beats. To this day, you got [New York] rappers trying to rhyme on trap beats, because they want a deal to pay their bills. That's what sells. So you lose the integrity of New York Hip Hop. I just think the fashion in Hip Hop and the way it's being portrayed is definitely colorful. We're about to bring it back to the dark side. That's the Hip Hop we know about-that street shit.\"",

According to Sony, Ready at Dawn utilized \"state-of-the-art visual technologies\" that allowed \"higher quality environments and characters.\" \"Ghost of Sparta\" offers \"over 25% more gameplay\" than \"Chains of Olympus\", while adding more enemies on screen and more boss encounters. Development of \"Ghost of Sparta\" took 23 months to complete. Due to Weerasuriya's schedule at Ready at Dawn, he could not return to direct; Dana Jan, the lead level designer for \"Chains of Olympus\", became director for \"Ghost of Sparta\". At Comic-Con 2010, Jan noted that when development began in 2008, the goal was to make the game bigger than \"Chains of Olympus\", which had apparently pushed the PSP to its functional limits. Jan stated that \"Ghost of Sparta\" took the PSP to its \"absolute capacity\", with another feature being more on-screen foes. The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the platinum trophy from \"God of War III\". The trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall.com, which became the official site for \"Ghost of Sparta\" on May 4. Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between \"God of War\" and \"God of War II\" was because \"It seemed to make a lot of sense to fill in that void.\"",

Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis \u2013 reducing the volume of the bolus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme within anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours .

In the first animated series made in 1973, Morticia was voiced by Janet Waldo. Jones also voiced this character in an episode of \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" that featured the family. In the 1992 animated series, she was voiced by Nancy Linari. In the 2010 Broadway musical, Morticia was portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth.

The rotation of the Earth creates convective eddies in the outer core region that cause it to function as a dynamo. This generates a magnetosphere about the Earth that deflects particles from the solar wind, which prevents significant erosion of the atmosphere from sputtering. As heat from the core is transferred outward toward the mantle, the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid outer core region to freeze, thereby releasing thermal energy and causing the solid inner core to grow. This iron crystallization process has been ongoing for about a billion years. In the modern era, the radius of the inner core is expanding at an average rate of roughly per year, at the expense of the outer core. Nearly all of the energy needed to power the dynamo is being supplied by this process of inner core formation.",

This navigation is mediated by the neuronal growth cone, a structure that responds to the cues by ligand-receptor signalling systems that activate downstream pathways inducing changes in the cytoskeleton. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons leaving the eye through the optic nerve are blocked from exiting the developing pathway by Slit2 and Sema5A inhibition, expressed bordering the optic nerve pathway. Ssh expressed at the central nervous system midline inhibits crossing prior to the chiasm, where it is downregulated. The organization of RGC axons changes from retinotopic to a flat sheet-like orientation as they approach the chiasm site.",

It means adoration, it means recognizing the real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist; it means respect and an attitude of faith of a man who prostrates before God because he knows that everything comes from Him, and we feel speechless, dumbfounded, before the wondrousness, his goodness, and his mercy. That is why it is not the same to place the hand, and to receive communion in any fashion, than doing it in a respectful way; it is not the same to receive communion kneeling or standing up, because all these signs indicate a profound meaning.\"",

He praised her vocals as \"breathtaking, exquisitely emotive, mournful, and mature\" and added that the song \"exudes the fragrance of a Grammy Award\". According to Ann Powers of the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"If I Were a Boy\" is Beyonc\u00e9's Streisand moment and \"a tender, fairly simple ballad that [she] uses to prove she's a great vocal actress\". Powers concluded, \"This isn't just another breakup song; it's an elegy for female empowerment, Beyonc\u00e9's admission that no amount of money, fame or skill can solve the basic inequity between her man's heart and her own.\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that \"If I Were a Boy\" could become as commercially successful as \"Irreplaceable\" because of its radio-friendly appeal. James Montgomery of MTV News complimented the \"tear-jerking power\" of \"If I Were a Boy\" and noted that it reveals \"sides of Beyonc\u00e9 we never knew existed\".",

The presidential elections of 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016 produced an Electoral College winner who did not receive the most votes in the general election. In 1824, there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, so the true national popular vote is uncertain. When no candidate received a majority of electoral votes in 1824, the election was decided by the House of Representatives. For these two reasons, the 1824 election is distinguishable from the latter four elections, which were held after all states had instituted the popular selection of electors, and in each of which a single candidate won an outright majority of electoral votes, thus becoming president without a contingent election in the House of Representatives. The true national popular vote total was also uncertain in the 1960 election, and the plurality winner depends on how votes for Alabama electors are allocated.",

This prime meridian was used to provide measurement of the earth, but had many problems because of the lack of latitude measurement. Many years later around the 19th century there was still concerns of the prime meridian. The idea of having one prime meridian came from William Parker Snow, because he realized the confusion of having multiple prime meridian locations. Many of theses geographical locations were traced back to the ancient Greeks, and others were created by several nations. Multiple locations for the geographical meridian meant that there was inconsistency, because each country had their own guidelines for where the prime meridian was located.",

It also reduces the risk of life-threatening conditions such as anemia, or hemorrhage. Stem cell transplants can be done by obtaining cells from the bone-marrow, blood or umbilical-cord blood. Stem cell transplants can use the cells from one's self, called an autologous stem cell transplant or they can use cells from another person, known as an allogenic stem cell transplant. The type used in childhood leukemia is typically allogenic. The donors used must be a match to the child getting the transplant by a marker called HLA",

Many children born with blonde hair develop darker hair as they age, with the majority of natural blondes developing a hair color of a dark blonde hue by the time they reach middle age. Pregnancy hormones hasten this process. Natural light blonde hair is rare in adulthood, with claims of the world's population ranging from 2% naturally blonde to 16% in the US. Blonde hair is most commonly found in Northern and Western Europeans and their descendants but can be found spread around most of Europe. Studies in 2012 showed that naturally blonde hair of Melanesians is caused by a recessive mutation in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1). In the Solomon Islands, 26% of the population carry the gene; however, it is absent outside of Oceania.",

If a person were to consolidate all ten commandments within one body, they would obtain a power on par with the Demon King, who is so powerful, he cannot even exist on Britannia without destroying it, and everyone on it.

It allows matching-up of homologous pairs prior to their segregation, and possible chromosomal crossover between them. Synapsis takes place during prophase I of meiosis. When homologous chromosomes synapse, their ends are first attached to the nuclear envelope. These end-membrane complexes then migrate, assisted by the extranuclear cytoskeleton, until matching ends have been paired. Then the intervening regions of the chromosome are brought together, and may be connected by a protein-RNA complex called the synaptonemal complex. Autosomes undergo synapsis during meiosis, and are held together by a protein complex along the whole length of the chromosomes called the synaptonemal complex. Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis; however, the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present at one end of each sex chromosome.",

This \"air gap\" is seen above the sink as a small cylindrical fixture mounted parallel with the faucet. In the base cabinet under the sink, the drain hose from the dishwasher feeds the \"top\" of the air gap, and the \"bottom\" of the air gap is plumbed into the sink drain below the basket, or into a garbage disposal unit. When installed and maintained properly, the air gap works as described above, and prevents drain water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher, possibly contaminating dishes. Water flowing from the fixture into the sink indicates a need for maintenance or repair.",

By law, the appointments must yield a \"fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country\", and as stipulated in the Banking Act of 1935, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board are two of seven members of the Board of Governors who are appointed by the President from among the sitting Governors. As an independent federal government agency, the Board of Governors does not receive funding from Congress, and the terms of the seven members of the Board span multiple presidential and congressional terms. Once a member of the Board of Governors is appointed by the president, he or she functions mostly independently. The Board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. It also supervises and regulates the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks, and the U.S. banking system in general.",

                        "text": "Angular cheilitis is a fairly non specific term which describes the presence of an inflammatory lesion in a particular anatomic site (i.e. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. In some cases, the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips, and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border (the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face) onto the facial skin. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. There is not usually any bleeding. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. If \"Staphylococcus aureus\" is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts. In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue.",

The simple ridged roof consists of declined rafters that rest on vertical wall-plates on top of each wall. Tiles are often used as a roof covering although galvanised steel and bitumen could also be found. The roof often extends toward the front of a house to cover a small porch. Supporting frames are seldom used in this type of construction and are usually made of wood. Building an adobe house is a community effort with relatives of the house owner assisting in the erection of the building.",

These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: the thermohaline circulation of the ocean leads to a 5\u00a0\u00b0C (9\u00a0\u00b0F) warming of the northern Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins. Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption, water retention, and rainfall on a regional level. Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to global warming or global cooling. The variables which determine climate are numerous and the interactions complex, but there is general agreement that the broad outlines are understood, at least insofar as the determinants of historical climate change are concerned.",

The discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word \"planet\" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" and making Neptune once again the outermost known planet in the Solar System.",

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from spontaneous generation.",

However, what most coherence theorists are concerned with is not all possible beliefs, but the set of beliefs that people actually hold. The main problem for a coherence theory of truth, then, is how to specify just this particular set, given that the truth of which beliefs are actually held can only be determined by means of coherence.",

It's meant to be inclusive of all races, and you can see yourself in all these characters...This is a multicultural movie and I'm going to make it even more multicultural in my approach to its casting. There's African-Americans in the movie...so it's a source of pride for me. The irony that [protesters] would label this with anything but the greatest pride, that the movie poster has Noah and Dev on it and my name on it. I don't know what else to do.\" In this quote, Shyamalan's reference to Noah Ringer can be explained by Noah's self-identification of his ancestry as \"American Indian,\" although critics of the film's casting have presumed that the actor is simply \"white\" when making their complaints.",

The culmination of the Yorktown campaign, the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict. The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain.",

Originally, the ashes were strewn over men's heads, but, probably because women had their heads covered in church, were placed on the foreheads of women. In the Catholic Church the manner of imposing ashes depends largely on local custom, since no fixed rule has been laid down. Although the account of \u00c6lfric of Eynsham shows that in about the year 1000 the ashes were \"strewn\" on the head, the marking of the forehead is the method that now prevails in English-speaking countries and is the only one envisaged in the \"Occasional Offices\" of the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea, a publication described as \"noticeably Anglo-Catholic in character\". In its ritual of \"Blessing of Ashes\", this states that \"the ashes are blessed at the beginning of the Eucharist; and after they have been blessed they are placed on the forehead of the clergy and people.\" The Ash Wednesday ritual of the Church of England, Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, contains \"The Imposition of Ashes\" in its Ash Wednesday liturgy. On Ash Wednesday, the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, traditionally takes part in a penitential procession from the Church of Saint Anselm to the Basilica of Santa Sabina, where, in accordance with the custom in Italy and many other countries, ashes are sprinkled on his head, not smudged on his forehead, and he places ashes on the heads of others in the same way.",

The convention used for North American transformers is that, facing the high voltage side of the transformer, the H1 terminal is on the observer's right. A transformer is called \"additive\" if, conceptually, connecting the high-voltage terminal to the adjacent low-voltage terminal gives a total voltage between the other two terminals that is the sum of the high voltage and low voltage ratings, when the high-voltage winding is excited at rated voltage. The H1 and X2 terminals are physically adjacent. In the \"subtractive\" arrangement, the H1 and X1 terminals are adjacent, and the voltage measured between H2 and X2 would be the difference of the high voltage and low voltage windings. Pole mounted distribution transformers are manufactured with additive polarity, while instrument transformers are made with subtractive polarity. Where markings have been obscured or are suspect, a test can be made by interconnecting the windings and exciting the transformer, and measuring the voltages.",

Even Rousseau (or Maria-Theresa) did not use the exact words but actually \"Qu'ils mangent de la brioche\", \"Let them eat brioche\" (a rich type of bread). Marie Antoinette was an unpopular ruler; therefore, people attribute the phrase \"let them eat cake\" to her, in keeping with her reputation as being hard-hearted and disconnected from her subjects.",

However, none of these tables were correct\u2014the 19th century tables arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic weight (or atomic mass). It was left to the English physicist Henry Moseley to base the periodic table on the atomic number (the number of protons). Mendeleyev died in 1907, six years after the first Nobel Prizes were awarded. He came within one vote of winning in 1906, but died the next year.

Some ratings of controversial games indicate they are not targeted at young children (\"Mature\" (M) or \"Adults Only\" (AO) in the US, or 15 or 18 in the UK). The packaging warns such games should not be sold to children. In the US, ESRB ratings are not legally binding, but many retailers take it upon themselves to refuse the sale of these games to minors. In the United Kingdom (UK), the BBFC ratings are legally binding. UK retailers also enforce the PEGI ratings, which are not legally binding.",

During his reign in Upper Egypt, King Narmer defeated his enemies on the Delta and merged both the Kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt under his single rule. Narmer is shown on palettes wearing the double crown, composed of the lotus flower representing Upper Egypt and the papyrus reed representing Lower Egypt - a sign of the unified rule of both parts of Egypt which was followed by all succeeding rulers. In mythology, the unification of Egypt is portrayed as the falcon-god, called Horus and identified with Lower Egypt, as conquering and subduing the god Set, who was identified with Upper Egypt. Divine kingship, which would persist in Egypt for the next three millennia, was firmly established as the basis of Egypt's government. The unification of societies along the Nile has also been linked to the end of the African humid period.",

In 1768 he became a judge in the county's court of common pleas. When New York created a revolutionary government in 1775, Wisner was sent to the New York Provincial Congress. That body, in turn, named him as a delegate to the Continental Congress where he served through 1776. Wisner was in Congress when the Declaration of Independence adopted, but the New York delegation was not authorized to declare independence, and so Wisner could not take part in the voting. The claim made years later that Wisner was the only member of the New York delegation to vote in favor of independence seems to be without foundation; he did not vote because he could not vote. After the New York delegation was finally authorized to support the Declaration, a signing ceremony took place in August 1776, but Wisner was not present in Congress to sign.",

The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of De Beers and markets rough diamonds from De Beers-operated mines. De Beers and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40% of annual world diamond production. For most of the 20th century over 80% of the world's rough diamonds passed through De Beers, but by 2001\u20132009 the figure had decreased to around 45%, and by 2013 the company's market share had further decreased to around 38% in value terms and even less by volume. De Beers sold off the vast majority of its diamond stockpile in the late 1990s \u2013 early 2000s and the remainder largely represents working stock (diamonds that are being sorted before sale).

According to the nuclear shell model, the protons and neutrons of a nuclide are a quantum mechanical system organized into discrete energy levels with unique quantum numbers. For a neutron to decay, the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled, meaning they are each occupied by two protons with spin up and spin down. The Pauli exclusion principle therefore disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei. The situation is similar to electrons of an atom, where electrons have distinct atomic orbitals and are prevented from decaying to lower energy states, with the emission of a photon, by the exclusion principle.",

She received favorable reviews for her performance.

Modern brewers also sometimes make use of American or Continental hops. South-east England, particularly Kent, is the traditional hop growing area; brewers in the north and west used to economise on the cost of importing hops by producing beers with more of a malt character, a regional distinction that has not entirely vanished. A characteristic technique is dry hopping, where hops are added during the fermentation phase in addition to those that went into the initial boil. Worcestershire and Herefordshire has also been a major hop-growing area. The jargon of the areas is distinguished from that of Kent in certain words. Thus in Kent the drying house is known as an oast-house, in Worcestershire as a kiln, a hop-field is called a hop-garden, in Worcestershire a hop-yard.",

As Harry and the Potters increased in popularity, other wizard rock bands started to emerge. Brian Ross and Bradley Mehlenbacher originally conceived Draco and the Malfoys as a parody of Harry and the Potters, who were performing at a local house party. In April 2005, Matt Maggiacomo invited Harry and the Potters to play at an all-Harry Potter show at his Rhode Island home. That night, Maggiacomo made his debut as \"The Whomping Willows\", and his friends, Mehlenbacher and his brother, Brian Ross, played for the first time as \"Draco and the Malfoys\".",

Eisenhower, created a new civilian agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to oversee an American space program.

In response, Kennedy announced a far more ambitious goal on May 25, 1961: to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. This already had a name: Project Apollo.",

In order to reach this conclusion, they directly ignore the declarations of secession by the seceding states, the declarations of congressmen who left Congress to join the Confederacy, and the treatment of slavery in the Confederate Constitution. They also deny or minimize the wartime writings and speeches of Confederate leaders in favor of postwar views. (See Cornerstone Speech.) Supporters often stress the idea of secession as a defense against a Northern threat to their way of life and say that the threat violated the states' rights guaranteed by the Constitution. They believe that any state had the right to secede, a point strongly denied by the North. The Lost Cause portrayed the South as more adherent to Christian values than the allegedly greedy North. It portrayed slavery as more benevolent than cruel, alleging that it taught Christianity and \"civilization.\" Stories of happy slaves were often used as propaganda in an effort to defend slavery; the United Daughters of the Confederacy had a \"Faithful Slave Memorial Committee,\" and erected the Heyward Shepherd monument in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. These stories would be used to explain slavery to Northerners. Many times they also portrayed slave owners being kind to their slaves. In explaining Confederate defeat, the Lost Cause says that the main factor was not qualitative inferiority in leadership or fighting ability but the massive quantitative superiority of the Yankee industrial machine. At the peak of troop strength in 1863, Union soldiers outnumbered Confederate soldiers by over two to one, and financially the Union had three times the bank deposits of the Confederacy.",

These neurons innervate skeletal muscle fibers through the propagation of action potentials down their axons (through ventral roots and cranial nerves), and they stimulate skeletal muscle fibers at neuromuscular junctions where they synapse with the motor end plates of muscle fibers. In humans, these axons can be as long as one meter. Motor neurons themselves fall into three main classes: alpha-motor neurons control extrafusal muscle fibers, meaning that they innervate skeletal muscles leading to movement; gamma-motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers, controlling the sensitivity of muscle spindles to stretch; beta-motor neurons are capable of synapsing on either type of muscle fiber. Alpha-motor neurons can further be divided into three separate subclasses, distinguished according to the contractile properties of the motor units that they form: fast-twitch fatigable (FF), fast-twitch fatigue-resistant (FR), and slow-twitch fatigue-resistant (S). The composition of a motor pool may consist of multiple classes and subclasses of motor neurons.",

The Peak 2 Peak Gondola was built by the Doppelmayr Garaventa Group in 2007 and 2008 at a cost of CDN$51 million. The Peak 2 Peak Gondola is the first Doppelmayr \"3S\" tri-cable lift in North America; there are four similar but smaller lifts in Europe which were built in 1991, 1994, 2002, 2004 and 2010 in Switzerland, Austria, France and Germany.

It denied the German military air superiority over the English Channel, making a seaborne invasion (planned as Operation Sea Lion) impossible in the face of Britain's naval power. Strategically, the overall situation at home and abroad at the end of the battle might be considered \"air parity\" between Britain and Germany.

The movie was dramatized from a Washington Post series about race relations in the high school football fishbowl of 1971, as the Hollywood-underdog T.C. Williams Titans took on the powerful Marshall Statesmen (coached by Ed Henry). The most notable dramatic license taken in the movie was to convert what was actually a regular-season matchup between Marshall and T.C. Williams into a made-for-Hollywood state championship. In reality, the Marshall game was the toughest game T.C. Williams played all year and the actual state championship (against Andrew Lewis High School of the Roanoke Valley) was a 27-0 blowout. The Titans actually did win the Marshall game on a fourth down come-from-behind play at the very end of the game. In addition to the added drama of the Marshall game, there were apparently some legal issues concerning the use of Andrew Lewis High School's name in the movie.",

The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided, amorphous state, and easily reverts to lead, lead dioxide and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges. As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges, some lead sulfate is not recombined into electrolyte and slowly converts to a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging. Thus, not all the lead is returned to the battery plates, and the amount of usable active material necessary for electricity generation declines over time.",

Feeling inspired, Perkins wrote the song, \"Daddy Sang Bass\" in 1967. Cash says the line, \"Me and little brother will join right in there\" was written about Cash's brother Jack, who died when they were both boys. In the song the line is sung by Don Reid and Lew DeWitt of The Statler Brothers who are uncredited on the record, as is Jan Howard who sang the line \"Mama sang tenor\" also in the song's chorus. Howard's part is frequently incorrectly credited to June Carter who would sing the line in concert with Cash.",

In such systems, code referred to as the \"trusted base\" is responsible for approving programs for execution, assuring they cannot perform operations detrimental to the system's stability without first being detected and dealt with. A very common strategy of guaranteeing that such operations are impossible is to base the system around a high-level language, such as Java, whose design precludes dangerous constructs; many are entirely written in such a language, with only the minimum amount of low-level code being used. Since language-based systems can assure ahead of time that they cannot do things that can damage the system (such as corrupting memory by dereferencing dangling pointers), it is possible for them to avoid expensive address space switches needed by traditional OSes; because of this, microkernels are more popular than traditional systems. A more extreme form of this is a high-level language computer architecture, where the trusted base is pushed into hardware, and the entire system is written in a high-level language.",

It is also expressed in cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells, such as RBCs, leukocytes, and platelets, as well as from erythroid-progenitor cells. Of note, HK1 is the sole hexokinase isoform found in the cells and tissues which rely most heavily on glucose metabolism for their function, including brain, erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and fibroblasts.

In this scenario, Daryl (filling the role of Rick) could be the one to pull the trigger and kill Dwight in that meeting with Governor Milton (or Georgie). However, Daryl \u2014 the guy who exiled Dwight from Alexandria \u2014 would feel much less remorse about killing Dwight than Rick does in the comics.\"",

Kidding is the process when the doe is physically giving birth to her kids, also known as the new born goats themselves. The doe will usually start showing signs around 2 to 3 days prior to labor, but in some cases, the doe will show no signs and have her kids with no problems. Goats are known for not really needing assistance when kidding time comes around, but it is always a good idea to plan ahead. There are multiple positions that the kid can try and come out that will cause many difficulties for the doe. The kid should always come out head first along with the two front hooves. If the kid is not coming out in this orientation, the action of having to glove up and reset the kids position may take place. There are multiple positions the kid can come out in that will cause difficulties for the doe. For the head first with one or both legs back, all that has to be done is find the legs and pull them forward. Once they are forward, the mother should be able to finish birthing on her own. For both legs out, head turned back or down, just find the head and pull it forward to help the doe through the kidding process. The breech is known as the impossible birth, and the kid must be pushed back into the uterus to rearrange its position. One should always be careful not to tear any of the doe\u2019s interior, or that will lead to more complications. And finally, the last possible complication includes the multiples coming out together. For this, an evaluation must take place on which twin will require the least amount of manoeuvring and pull that one out first. If any of these procedures take longer than 15 minutes, call a veterinarian right away and make sure that the doe is alright. After the birth takes place, the placenta should pass within an hour after the kidding. If it does not pass, call a vet. If the placenta is not removed from the mother\u2019s area, she will most likely end up eating it. It will neither benefit nor harm the doe if she eats the placenta.",

A neural synapse is the space between brain cells, or neurons, that allows chemical signals to be passed from one neuron to another. Chemicals called neurotransmitters leave one cell, travel across the synapse, and are taken in by the next neuron through a neurotransmitter receptor. This creates a connection between the two neurons called a neural pathway. Memory relies on the strengthening of these neural pathways, associating one neuron with another. When we learn something, new pathways are made between neurons in the brain which then communicate through chemical signals. If these cells have a history of sending out certain signals under specific chemical conditions within the brain, they are then primed to work most effectively under similar circumstances. State-dependent memory happens when a new neural connection is made while the brain is in a specific chemical state - for instance, a child with ADHD learns their multiplication tables while on stimulant medication. Because their brain created these new connections related to multiplication tables while the brain was chemically affected by the stimulant medication, their neurons will be primed in the future to remember these facts best when the same levels of medication are present in the brain.",

The song was the final single which he recorded for Sun Records, the label for which he had honed his early rockabilly style. After he signed for new label RCA Victor, his recordings began to show more of a pop music influence, but continued to appear on the country charts, and one week after \"I Forgot To Remember To Forget\" was replaced at number one, Presley regained the top spot with \"Heartbreak Hotel\", which remained atop the listing for 17 consecutive weeks. \"I Forgot To Remember To Forget\" was the first chart-topper for Presley, who would go on to be regarded as the most successful and influential recording artist of all time and feted as the \"King of Rock and Roll\".",

The minerals at the top of the illustration (given aside) are first to crystallize and so the temperature gradient can be read to be from high to low with the high temperature minerals being on the top and the low temperature ones on the bottom. Since the surface of the Earth is a low temperature environment compared to the zones of rock formation, the chart also easily shows the stability of minerals with the ones at bottom being most stable and the ones at top being quickest to weather, known as the Goldich dissolution series. This is because minerals are most stable in the conditions closest to those under which they had formed. Simply put, the high temperature minerals, the first ones to crystallize in a mass of magma, are most unstable at the Earth's surface and quickest to weather because the surface is most different from the conditions under which they were created. On the other hand, the low temperature minerals are much more stable because the conditions at the surface are much more similar to the conditions under which they formed.",

Ionisation smoke alarms can quickly detect the small amounts of smoke produced by fast-flaming fires, such as cooking fires or those fueled by paper or flammable liquids. A newer, and perhaps safer, type is a photoelectric smoke detector. It contains a light source in a light-sensitive electric sensor, which is positioned at a 90-degree angles to the sensor. Normally, light from the light source shoots straight across and misses the sensor. When smoke enters the chamber, it scatters the light, which then hits the sensor and triggers the alarm. Photoelectric smoke detectors typically respond faster to a fire in its early, smoldering stage \u2013 before the source of the fire bursts into flames.",

Callaway's script was published in an edited \"young adult\" format, leaving in all descriptions of violence but omitting the harsher language. Filming took place in Mexico and California. \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" was released to negative reviews, but was a box office success, grossing $84 million worldwide against a $24 million budget. It is the second installment of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" series and was followed by \"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer\" in 2006.",

The Map task typically executes on the same node containing its assigned partition of data in the cluster. These Map tasks perform user-specified computations on each input key-value pair from the partition of input data assigned to the task, and generates a set of intermediate results for each key. The shuffle and sort phase then takes the intermediate data generated by each Map task, sorts this data with intermediate data from other nodes, divides this data into regions to be processed by the reduce tasks, and distributes this data as needed to nodes where the Reduce tasks will execute. The Reduce tasks perform additional user-specified operations on the intermediate data possibly merging values associated with a key to a smaller set of values to produce the output data. For more complex data processing procedures, multiple MapReduce calls may be linked together in sequence.",

Warner Bros. decided to release \"Mad Max 2\" in the United States, but they recognised that the first film was not popular in North America. Although the original \"Mad Max\" was becoming popular through cable channel showings, Warner Bros. decided to change the name of its sequel to \"The Road Warrior\". The advertising for the film, including print ads, trailers, and TV commercials, did not refer to the Max character at all, and all shied away from the fact that the film was a sequel. For the majority of viewers, their first inkling of \"Road Warrior\" being a sequel to \"Mad Max\" was when they saw the black and white, archival footage from the previous film, during the prologue.",

Eventually they were effectively removed by Protestants during the 1800s, with some Protestants arguing against their inclusion for theological reasons, and with other Protestants citing the cost of publishing the hidden books as a major factor in removing them. Today it is possible to find Protestant Bibles which now include the Apocrypha. The status of the deuterocanonicals remains unchanged in Catholic and Orthodox Christianities.",

The sheet on which he wrote the song appears in \"8 Mile\" in a scene where his character is writing while riding the bus.",

Two molecules of water can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say oxygen-hydrogen bonding; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.",

Since this lb/lb is force divided by force, formula_3 is dimensionless. Multiply it by 100 and you get the percent (%) of the weight of the vehicle required to maintain slow steady speed. formula_3 is often multiplied by 1000 to get the parts per thousand, which is the same as kilograms (kg force) per metric ton (tonne = 1000\u00a0kg ), which is the same as pounds of resistance per 1000 pounds",

Initially, the Word of Wisdom was treated as a recommendation, and the early Latter Day Saints would still drink alcohol on occasion. During the late-19th century, church leaders began to interpret the Word of Wisdom as a mandatory requirement for members. This increased respect for the Word of Wisdom, combined with other scriptures in Doctrine and Covenants led congregations to begin substituting water for the sacramental wine. The practice was officially adopted church-wide in 1912.",

FM radio was initially mono, with only one audio channel represented by one signal. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, a large number of listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved through sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one signal and the difference in another signal. That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the sum signal while ignoring the difference signal, which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a sum signal to left and right channels if both sum and difference signals are received. Without the requirement for backward compatibility, a simpler method could have been chosen.",

Their reproduction process does not need male fertilization, although researchers observed pseudo-copulation that promotes fertilization during ovulation. This process involves the alternation between male-typical and female-typical sexual behaviours, driven by progesterone, in both lizards; corresponding to the state of their partner. The lizards reproduce by parthenogenesis, but offspring are not necessarily clones of their mother. Under normal reproductive processes, a species has each chromosome pair separated, copied, and paired back with its counterpart. The desert grassland whiptail lizard, however, has chromosome triplets where each triplet is paired with its copy rather than its counterparts. This reproductive method enables the asexual desert grassland whiptail lizard to have a genetic diversity previously thought to have been unique to sexually reproductive species.",

It seems that he thinks of Tyler as a disappointment and when Tyler gets into a fist-fight with Matt Donovan at a party, Richard tells him to never embarrass his family again. When Tyler gets into a fight with Jeremy, he takes them outside and tells them to fight rather than talk to solve their problems. He had an unhappy marriage with Carol Lockwood and they constantly fight; he also flirts with Pearl. Although he seems kind and amicable to the outside world, he was actually quite selfish. In the season one finale, during Founders Day, he helps John Gilbert execute his plan to kill the tomb vampires. However, it backfires when he is affected by the device that neutralizes the vampires, due to carrying the werewolf gene. The deputies believe him to be a vampire and lock him in the basement, where he was killed by one of the tomb vampires.",

In the episode \"Bloodletting\", the shooter, Otis, takes them to an isolated farm occupied by Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson), a veterinarian who works to save Carl's life by using a transfusion of Rick's blood. Carl recovers with Shane's help in the episode \"Cherokee Rose\". In the episode \"Secrets\", Lori tells Rick that she is pregnant and reveals that she and Shane had been together after she believed he died. In the mid-season finale, \"Pretty Much Dead Already\", the group discovers that Hershel has kept walkers in the barn, including his family, believing that he can save them. Despite Rick's refusal, Shane opens the barn and kills the walkers inside, until one is revealed to be Sophia. Left with no other choice, Rick shoots Sophia dead. In the mid-season premiere, \"Nebraska\", Rick is forced to kill two men in a bar to protect the group, but takes one of their group members, Randall Culver (Michael Zegen), as a prisoner in the episode \"Triggerfinger\". In the episode \"Better Angels\", Rick decides to keep the prisoner alive. Shane ultimately kills Randall, and then tries to kill Rick, who stabs him in the heart in self-defense. Shane comes back to life as a walker, but Carl kills him. In the season finale, \"Beside the Dying Fire\", a walker horde overruns the farm. Rick reveals to the escaped group that Jenner had told him that everyone is infected. He tells Lori he killed Shane to protect himself as well as the group, but she recoils from him, horrified. Rick then coldly dares any would-be traitors to abandon the safety of the group.",

The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan (poly-\"N\"-acetylglucosamine and \"N\"-acetylmuramic acid), which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. intracellular parasites such as \"Mycoplasma\") contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. This is notably expressed through the classification into gram positive and gram negative bacteria.",

The American inventor Robert Fulton conceived of his submarine \"Nautilus\" in the first years of the nineteenth century and took it to Europe when the United States proved largely uninterested in the design. During the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America, faced with a similar situation to that of the colonies during the War of Independence, developed an operational submarine CSS \"H.L. Hunley\", whose destruction of the USS \"Housatonic\" in Charleston Harbor in February 1864 was the first successful submarine attack in history. By the early-twentieth century, the world's navies were beginning to adopt submarines in larger numbers. Like Bushnell's design, these boats mimicked the natural forms of marine animals in their hull designs. As one contemporary historian of submarines observed in 1901, the evolution of modern submarine evolved from the whale, which he deemed a \"submarine made by nature out of a mammal.",

Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting. Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat-wick, central-draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast variants.",

The earliest Lost Dutchman's mine in Arizona was said to have been near Wickenburg, about north-west of the Superstition Mountains: a \"Dutchman\" was allegedly discovered dead in the desert near Wickenburg in the 1870s alongside saddlebags filled with gold. Blair suggested that \"fragments of this legend have perhaps become attached to the mythical mine of Jacob Waltz\".",

Vespucci, following his four voyages exploring the coastlines of Venezuela and Brazil, first developed the idea that the newly discovered western land was in fact a continent. The German cartographer Martin Waldseem\u00fcller created the earliest known map showing the name \"America\", which he applied to the South American continent only. One later antique map labels the two landmasses \"North America or Mexicana\" and \"South America or Peruana\".",

Two centuries later, the gold certificates began being issued in the United States when the US Treasury issued such certificates that could be exchanged for gold. The United States Government first authorized the use of the gold certificates in 1863. On April 5, 1933 the US Government restricted the private gold ownership in the United States and therefore, the gold certificates stopped circulating as money (this restriction was reversed on January 1, 1975). Nowadays, gold certificates are still issued by gold pool programs in Australia and the United States, as well as by banks in Germany, Switzerland and Vietnam.",

Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up. Instead, the raised aluminium blister was pushed down into the can, with a small unscored piece that kept the tab connected after being pushed inside. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person's finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening. An unusual feature of the push-tab Coors Beer cans was that they had a second, smaller, push-tab at the top as an airflow vent\u00a0\u2014 a convenience that was lost with the switch from can opener to pull-tab. The \"push-tab\" was introduced into Australia in the early 1980s and was locally known as \"pop-tops\".",

Wonka disguises himself as the storeowner of a local candy shop, which quickly attracts the attention of the town's residents and candy- obsessed Charlie Bucket. Despite having no money to spend on sweets, Charlie frequents the shop regularly and befriends the owner, unaware that he is Willy Wonka. Charlie tells him about Wonka's career (\"Willy Wonka! Willy Wonka!\") and remarks that he would do anything to see inside the factory, giving Wonka an idea. Charlie returns to the decrepit shack he lives in (\"The Candy Man Reprise\"), which he shares with his mother and four bed-ridden grandparents: Grandpa George, Grandma Georgina, Grandpa Joe, and Grandma Josephine.",

Later in the game, Lieutenant Rosa gives the player a new upgraded taser, which is much more powerful, causing the enemy's legs to give out. One hit or shot after that will kill any enemy. Common uses for it are safely attacking enemies with guns (since it allows players to stun them from a distance and then seize the gun while the enemy is incapacitated), countering an immediate attack (since using the taser does not require the precise timing that blocking does) and obtaining the chance to make a free hit (a hit where the player does not risk being hit first). However, it has to recharge between shots so it cannot be used to bypass the game's system of carefully fighting enemies.",

Most NHL players will need to clear waivers before they are assigned to a minor league team; exceptions are listed below. Clearing waivers means every other team in the NHL has the option to \"claim\" that player off of the \"waiver wire\", thus assuming his contract (and cap hit; this varies for re-entry waivers), and providing only minor monetary compensation to the originating team (unless the waivers requested were re-entry waivers); financial compensations are listed below. If a player clears waivers, the team has the right to either loan the player to a minor league affiliate which is generally a team in the American Hockey League (AHL), or the team can elect to keep that player with their club. Once a player has cleared waivers, they do not need to again clear them for the shorter of: (1) 30 cumulative days on the NHL roster; or (2) until they have played in ten NHL games. If a player refuses to report to the minors, the team can use that as grounds to suspend the player (\"i.e.\", not pay them).",

Gobineau lived a modest, ascetic lifestyle and became engulfed with an obsession with ancient Persia that soon got out of control as he sought to prove that ancient Persia was founded by his much admired Aryans, leading him to engage in what Irwin called \"deranged\" theories about Persia's history. In 1865 Gobineau published \"Les religions et les philosophies dans l'Asie centrale\", an account of his travels in Persia and encounters with the various esoteric Islamic sects he discovered being practiced out in the Persian countryside. Gobineau's mystical frame of mind led him to feel in Persia what he called \"\"un certain plaisir\"\" (\"a certain pleasure\") as no else in the world did he feel the same sort of joy he felt when viewing the ruins of Persia. Gobineau had a low opinion of Islam, a religion invented by the Arab Mohammed, who Gobineau viewed thus as part of the \"Semitic race\", unlike the Persians whose Indo-European language led Gobineau to see them as Aryans. Gobineau believed that Shia Islam was part of a \"revolt\" by the Aryan Persians against the Semitic Arabs, seeing a close connection between Shia Islam and Persian nationalism. Gobineau's understanding of Persia was distorted and confused as he mistakenly believed that Shi'ism was practiced only in Persia, that in Shi'ism the Imam Ali is much more venerated than Muhammad and he was unaware that Shia Islam only became the state religion of Persia under the Safavids. Based on his own experiences, Gobineau believed that the Persians did not really believe in Islam with the faith of the Prophet just being a mere cover over a society that still preserved many pre-Islamic features. Gobineau also described the savage persecution of the followers of B\u00e1bism and of the new religion of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith by the Persian state, which was determined to uphold Shia Islam as the state religion. Gobineau approved of the persecution of the Babi, writing that they were \"veritable communists\" and \"true and pure supporters of socialism\", as every bit as dangerous as the French socialists, writing the Peacock Trone was right to stamp out B\u00e1bism. Gobineau was one of the first Westerners to examine the esoteric sects of Persia, and though his work was idiosyncratic, he did spark scholarly interest in an aspect of Persia that had been ignored by Westerners until then. Gobineau's command of Farsi was only average and his Arabic was even worse, but since there were few Western Orientalists who knew Farsi, Gobineau was able to pass himself off for decades as a leading Orientalist who knew Persia like no one else.",

Previously, black education was administered by provincial governments. With the creation of the department, the central national government assumed control of all black education in South Africa. Racial segregation in education became mandatory under the Act.",

According to the historian Lawrence Marceau, during the late-sixteenth century, dramatic changes in Japanese printing technology were sparked by \"two overseas sources\". The first was the movable type printing-press established by the Jesuits in Kyushu in 1590. The second was the looting of Korean books and book printing technology after the invasion of Korea. Before 1590, Buddhist monasteries handled virtually all book printing in Japan, and, according to historian Donald Shively, books and moveable type transported from Korea \"helped bring about the end of the monastic monopoly on printing.\" At the start of the invasion in 1592, Korean books and book printing technology were one of Japan's top priorities for looting, especially metal moveable type. One commander alone, Ukita Hideie, is said to have had 200,000 printing types and books removed from Korea's Gyeongbokgung Palace. In 1593, a Korean printing press with movable type was sent as a present for the Japanese Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei. The emperor commanded that it be used to print an edition of the Confucian \"Classic of Filial Piety\". Four years later in 1597, apparently due to difficulties encountered in casting metal, a Japanese version of the Korean printing press was built with wooden instead of metal type. In 1599, this press was used to print the first part of the Nihon Shoki. Eighty percent of Japan's book production was printed using moveable type between 1593 and 1625, but ultimately moveable type printing was supplanted by woodblock printing and was rarely used after 1650.",

This can be attributed to the fact that the Philippines was colonized by both Spain and the United States, and the system of laws of both nations strongly influenced the development of Philippine laws and jurisprudence. Even as the body of Philippine laws remain mostly codified, the Philippine Civil Code expressly recognizes that decisions of the Supreme Court \"form part of the law of the land\", belonging to the same class as statutes. The 1987 Philippine Constitution also explicitly grants to the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over laws and executive actions. The Supreme Court is composed of 1 Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices. The court sits either en banc or in divisions, depending on the nature of the case to be decided.",

Scotty had left Port Charles several years earlier and was now living in New York's Greenwich Village. Gail's mission worked when Scotty showed up in town. She smiled with satisfaction as father and son reunited.

The gap junctions that exist between adjacent FS cells are used to propagate calcium-mediated signals throughout the pituitary to coordinate the function of excitable endocrine cells distributed throughout the gland. The endocrine-FS cell gap junctions, alongside the FS-FS gap junctions form a cell network that allows information about the physiological environment to be transferred around the pituitary to coordinate its secretory function.",

Most states in the US have energy policies to help support wind energy development. State policies offer incentives and tax credits for both producers and consumers to make wind energy more affordable. These tax credits are towards personal finances or property value. Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and state grant programs are also used to increase wind energy usage in the United States. By using these incentives, the US can make wind power more prominent to push for renewable energy sources, in an effort to lessen its dependence on foreign oil, protect the environment, and stabilize its energy costs. This section outlines different financial incentives available by state, and programs designed to increase the development and use of wind power. It also displays state permitting and ordinance requirements, usually done on a county level, that are important to know before installing wind turbines.",

These impulses ultimately stimulate heart muscle to contract and thereby to eject blood from the ventricles into the arteries and the cardiac circulatory system; and they provide a system of intricately-timed and persistent signaling that controls the rhythmic beating of the heart muscle cells, especially the complex impulse-generation and muscle contractions in the atrial chambers. The rhythmic sequence (or sinus rhythm) of this signaling across the heart is coordinated by two groups of specialized cells, the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is situated in the upper wall of the right atrium, and the atrioventricular (AV) node located in the lower wall of the right heart between the atrium and ventricle. The sinoatrial node, often known as the \"cardiac pacemaker\", is the point of origin for producing a wave of electrical impulses that stimulates atrial contraction by creating an action potential across myocardium cells.",

The diversity of these proteins is such that actin is thought to be the protein that takes part in the greatest number of protein-protein interactions. For example, G-actin sequestering elements exist that impede its incorporation into microfilaments.

Darth Chef has not made an appearance in subsequent episodes, but has appeared with other characters in the background of the \"South Park\" opening sequence, and is mentioned in the episode \"Stunning and Brave\", when PC Principal says the kids drove him to kill himself, which is not true.",

Baboons roamed the Tower freely until, in 1833, a child was killed by their aggressive behaviour. Soon after, the entire menagerie was moved to Regents Park, to become what is today the London Zoo.

It shows the growth and evolution of the surfing scene since the first film, which presented only classic longboard surfing. O'Connell rides a shortboard, which was developed in the time between the two movies, and there are scenes of windsurfing and bodyboarding. The film illustrates how far surfing had spread, with footage of surf sessions in France, South Africa, Costa Rica, Australia, Bali, Java, and even Alaska. It also has a brief cameo appearance by morey surfer Felipe Zylbersztajn, Steve Irwin, and Mary, a crocodile from Irwin's Australia Zoo.",

The X.25 \"data link layer\", LAPB, provides a reliable data path across a data link (or multiple parallel data links, multilink) which may not be reliable itself. The X.25 \"packet layer\" provides the virtual call mechanisms, running over X.25 LAPB. The \"packet layer\" includes mechanisms to maintain virtual calls and to signal data errors in the event that the \"data link layer\" cannot recover from data transmission errors.

The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as \"almost a parody...of the original document\". The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that \"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.

With the new set of pigment cells, the cyclic behavior starts again, creating alternating pigmented and apigmented bars.",

The Quadruple or Grand Alliance of 1814, defined in the Treaty of Chaumont, between Great Britain, Austria, Russia and Prussia, had for its object the overthrow of Napoleon and his dynasty, and the confining of France within her traditional boundaries. The Triple Alliance of 1882 between Germany, Austria and Italy was ostensibly directed to the preservation of European peace against any possible aggressive action of France or Russia; and this led in turn, some ten years later, to the Dual Alliance between Russia and France, for mutual support in case of any hostile action of the other powers.",

In the Congress system, the main signatory powers met periodically (every two years or so) and collectively managed European affairs. This system was used in an attempt to address the Polish-Saxon crisis at Vienna and the question of Greek independence at Laibach. The following ten years saw five European Congresses where disputes were resolved with a diminishing degree of effectiveness. Finally, by 1822, the whole system had collapsed because of the irreconcilable differences of opinion among Britain, Austria, and Russia, and because of the lack of support for the Congress system in British public opinion. The Holy Alliance, which Castlereagh opposed, lingered a little longer. The order created by the Congress of Vienna was a mood that lasted much longer and worked to prevent major European wars until the First World War in 1914. Some scholars and historians have seen the Congress system as a forerunner of the modern collective security, international unity, and cooperative agreements of NATO, the EU, the League of Nations, and the United Nations.",

This surgery attaches the vas deferens directly to the epididymis, the coiled tube on the back of each testicle where sperm matures. A vasectomy can cause blockages or a break in the vas deferens or the epididymis. This surgery is used when a vasovasostomy won't work because sperm flow is blocked. The vas deferens is connected to the epididymis above the point of blockage.",

Ayush discovers his superpowers, but is unaware that he is a \"Daanush\" (the hybrid offspring of a daini and a human). He can be saved from turning to the dark side only by a girl who has the \"Devi-Maa\" Durga's symbol as her birthmark, and is referred to as the Doibik (divine conduit). Ishani, has the symbol of the Devi-Maa behind her neck. Sparks fly between Ayush and Ishani though they didn't see each other. Ishani who is in search of her lost mother, comes across her father, Akhilesh,who is a professor and a \"Revaavanshi\" (member of a clan of monster-hunters) and her sister 'Indu'. Maya sends a puppet daayan, Tina with a fake Durga symbol to marry Ayush, So that Maya can return and also to keep the family from knowing the real doibik.Ayush and Debrashree come under Tina's control during which Tina and Ayush get married while the rest of the family is spellbound and cast into a deep sleep. The marriage releases Maaya from the charms and spells that imprisoned her. The Signa Roy family reunites with Maaya, and Ayush learns about his real mother. Vashkor, Ishani's childhood friend and obsessive lover, attempts to marry Ishani by taking advantage of his unwell mother, a visually challenged priestess, Guru Maa, who raised Ishani after Shivani's disappearance.Fearing Ayush's budding romance with Ishani, and the growing ties and bonds of the Singharay with Ishani, Maya sends a message summoning an asur named \"Kalantakasur\" from \"Paathaal-Lohk\" to scare Ishani away. Kalantakasur gets enraged on Maya for cutting his daughter Tina's plait. To Maya's horror, Kalantakasur was goring and pounding Ayush not Ishani, Ayush fought back with his Daanush superstrengths without success. A distressed Ishani invokes the Devi-Maa for help, who swiftly heeds to her plea. Ishani enters a tranced religious dance (Thaandov) and manifests her Doibik form complete with Durga's attire, multiple arms and ashtraas. Initially, the beast seemed invincible despite multiple strikes, but after Maya tells Ishani the demon's achilles heel, she smites him dead with her trishul. Everyone witness the battle and learn that Ishani is the real Doibik.Maya plots again to separate the family from Ishani, she reveals to Ishani that she has trapped her mother Shivani in the form of a bird and threatens to kill Shivani if Ishani doesn't marry Vashkor, but Ayush interferes and stops the marriage again . Later, Ayush learns about his Daanush self. Maya proves herself as Deboshree's half sister by merging her magical plait with Deboshree's plait which shocks all and frightens Sathi. A few days later, Vashkor gains the abilities of a daayan by wearing Tina's cut-off plait and terrorises the Singha Roy family all night to get Maya's plait, but Deboshree revitalises a temporarily weakened Maya by letting daylight into the room at dawn, and saves the whole family.The Singharoy face new challenges after Indu is hypnotised by Maya, and releases Rhimjhim a petni (evil spirit) to hatch a new conspiracy to separate Ishani and Ayush. Rhimjhim makes a \"Raakhchakra\" (hex) to capture Ishani and Ayush but Ishani saves Ayush and finds herself trapped inside Rhimjhim's hex.

In addition, Chicano studies programs helped universities and colleges fulfill Affirmative Action requirements. During the mid 1990s, however, a study found that most Chicano studies programs were still very non-uniform. Part of the reason that many Chicano studies programs were not consistent in what was studied is that a core curriculum had not yet been formally published. The first primer of Chicano studies was published in 1980 by Diego Vigil, called \"From Indians to Chicanos: A Sociocultural History\". In addition, there was a lack of Chicano faculty with only 1.2% of faculty at U.S. colleges and universities having any \"Hispanic\" ethnicity at all in 1985. Many of the faculty teaching Chicano studies didn't feel that their own programs were \"qualitatively sound.\"",

He theorized that the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal gland work together as a unit to maintain homeostasis in emergencies. To identify and quantify adrenaline release during stress, beginning in about 1919 Cannon exploited an ingenious experimental setup. He would surgically excise the nerves supplying the heart of a laboratory animal such as a dog or cat. Then he would subject the animal to a stressor and record the heart rate response. With the nerves to the heart removed, he could deduce that if the heart rate increased in response to the perturbation, then the increase in heart rate must have resulted from the actions of a hormone. Finally, he would compare the results in an animal with intact adrenal glands with those in an animal from which he had removed the adrenal glands. From the difference in the heart rate between the two animals, he could infer further that the hormone responsible for the increase in heart rate came from the adrenal glands. Moreover, the amount of increase in the heart rate provided a measure of the amount of hormone released. Cannon became so convinced that the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal gland functioned as a unit that in the 1930s he formally proposed that the sympathetic nervous system uses the same chemical messenger\u2014adrenaline\u2014as does the adrenal gland. Cannon\u2019s notion of a unitary sympathoadrenal system persists to this day. Researchers in the area have come to question the validity of the notion of a unitary sympathoadrenal system, although clinicians often continue to lump together the two components.",

Other sources place the starting point at 1956 or 1957. Unlike older baby boomers, most of Generation Jones did not grow up with World War II veterans as fathers, and for them there was no compulsory military service and no defining political cause, as opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War had been for the older boomers.",

Prior to the National Maximum Speed Law that went into effect nationwide, North Carolina used to have 60\u00a0mph speed limits on two-lane primary and secondary roads. Inside the municipal limits, the statutory speed limit is 35\u00a0mph unless otherwise posted. The downtown statutory speed limit is 20\u00a0mph unless otherwise posted. \"Reduce Speed Ahead\" (RSA) signage is the norm whenever the speed limit drops at any level. Note that the NC DOT uses the imperative verb \"reduce\" instead of the adjectival form \"reduced\" that is standard in other states, although some municipalities now use \"reduced\" in their signs. In addition, a speed limit drop of 15\u00a0mph or greater normally includes a second warning sign after the RSA. For example, in a 55\u00a0mph zone, a sign prior to the RSA sign would say \"BEGIN 35 1000 FEET AHEAD\" and then the 35\u00a0mph posted speed limit. Three to eight lane boulevards with or without center turn lanes, range from 35\u00a0mph to 50\u00a0mph within municipal limits statewide.",

This is largely due to frequent washing of clothing and the body, and improved sanitation. Although such hygiene can be very important when it comes to maintaining good health, it can be problematic for the proper development of the immune system. The hygiene hypothesis is that humans evolved to be dependent on certain microorganisms that help establish the immune system, and modern hygiene practices can prevent necessary exposure to these microorganisms. \"Microorganisms and macroorganisms such as helminths from mud, animals, and feces play a critical role in driving immunoregulation\" (Rook, 2012). Essential microorganisms play a crucial role in building and training immune functions that fight off and repel some diseases, and protect against excessive inflammation, which has been implicated in several diseases. For instance, recent studies have found evidence supporting inflammation as a contributing factor in Alzheimer's Disease.",

More recently, Hobbs was selected by a panel of experts in 2000 as one of five \"Wisden\" cricketers of the 20th century. In 2009, he was selected by cricket historians and writers as a member of England's all-time best team, and included in a similar team to represent the best players worldwide in the history of cricket. Hobbs' Test batting average of 56.94 remained as of 2016 the sixth best among batsmen to have passed 5,000 runs, despite a rise in the number of batsmen who average more than 50 since 2000. Among openers who have scored 5,000 Test runs, he has the third best average behind Sutcliffe and Len Hutton. He was comfortably the leading Test run-scorer during his career, and had the highest number of Test runs at the time of his retirement. Between 1910 and 1929, he averaged 65.55 in Test cricket.",

The appellate court then makes the decision about what errors were made when the law was looked at more closely in the lower court. There were no errors made, the case would then end, but if the decision was reversed, the appellate court would then send the case back down to the lower court level.

The franchise would go on to have wins against its other fellow New Zealand clubs, apart from the Waikato/BOP Magic who it suffered defeats twice to. The Steel were left in a battle with the Queensland Firebirds late in the season to fight for the last semi-final spot. The Steel pulled off major wins at home to the Northern Mystics, Adelaide Thunderbirds and NSW Swifts to confirm a spot in the top four. This berth would only be short lived. A week later the Steel were beaten by five goals in Adelaide against the Thunderbirds, ending their 2009 season.",
